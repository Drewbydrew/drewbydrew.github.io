    <changelog>
        <change>Sorry this update took so long to come out. Lots happening in my life right now.</change>
        <change>Partially fixed issue where indicator would sometimes only appear as a solid white ball.</change>
        <change>This fix has only been tested on an iPhone 6S on iOS 9.3.3. Please give feedback if it's not good on your end.</change>
        <change>I am looking into whether or not it is possible for it to always be coloured, but I think this is an Apple-imposed limitation. Give me time. I will try.</change>
