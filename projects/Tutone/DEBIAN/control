Description: Two amazing themes in one.
 Hi beta testers! Sorry it’s been so long since the previous update. I’ve been super swamped with school, and I just finished exams. But here I am, back at it, with a handful of new app icons. I promise updates will be a little more frequent now! Enjoy!



 When I started to make this theme, I couldn’t decide if I liked it better flat, or with a gradient.
 
 So I did both.
 
 This theme includes two sets of icons, featuring over 130 in each. One set is flat, and the other has a gradient.
 This theme also includes a status bar theme, a settings theme, and three icon masks.
 Themed music controls are also available if you are using Winterboard (Anemone support is coming!).
 If you are using Anemone, most things should work right out of the box (except the music controls, sorry).
 If you are using Winterboard, you will need to install IconBundles.
 Please let me know if something is not right, or if there is something you would like themed.
 There is lots more to come! Including a full CC theme, a more complete status bar theme, a custom loading indicator, full iPad support, and lots more!
 
 Thank you for choosing Tutone :)
