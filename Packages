Description: Two amazing themes in one. 
 When I started to make this theme, I couldn`t decide if I liked it better flat, or with a gradient. 
 
 So I did both. 
 
 This theme includes two sets of icons, featuring over 130 in each. One set is flat, and the other has a gradient. 
 This theme also includes a status bar theme, a settings theme, and three icon masks. 
 Themed music controls are also available if you are using Winterboard (full Anemone support is coming!). 
 If you are using Anemone, most things should work right out of the box. 
 If you are using Winterboard, you will need to install IconBundles. 
 Please let me know if something is not right, or if there is something you would like themed. 
 There is lots more to come! Including a full CC theme, a more complete status bar theme, a custom loading indicator, full iPad support, and lots more! 
 
 Thank you for choosing Tutone :)
